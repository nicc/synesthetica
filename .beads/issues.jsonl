{"id":"synesthetica-n63","title":"SPEC: Grammar composition and conflict resolution","description":"## The Problem\n\nMultiple active grammars may respond to the same intents differently. How do we combine their outputs?\n\nCurrent implicit model: grammars are additive (each emits entities, compositor merges).\n\n### Data flow context\n```\nCMS → Ruleset → IntentFrame → Grammar(s) → SceneFrame → Renderer\n```\n\n- Ruleset interprets CMS into musical intents (PaletteIntent, MotionIntent, TextureIntent, ShapeIntent)\n- Each intent carries confidence\n- Multiple grammars receive the SAME IntentFrame\n- Each grammar emits entities to a SceneFrame\n- Compositor merges SceneFrames (concat + layout + blending)\n\n### Where this breaks down\n\n1. **Conflicting motion**: Grammar A interprets MotionIntent.flow as \"drift left\", Grammar B as \"drift right\"\n2. **Macro confusion**: User says \"emphasise rhythm\" — macroResponses guide which grammars to adjust, but they may respond in incompatible ways\n3. **Visual chaos**: Two \"reactive\" grammars both responding to onsets = doubled visual noise\n4. **Coherence**: User expects a unified visual response, not independent layers doing their own thing\n\n### Concrete example\n\nActive grammars: Starfield (discrete, transient) + Rain (continuous, persistent)\n\nUser plays a chord. Both grammars receive the same IntentFrame:\n- Starfield spawns burst of particles\n- Rain increases field density\n\nIs this composition? Or conflict? Depends on the grammars' traits and whether they're designed to complement.\n\n## Questions to answer\n\n1. **Are grammars truly independent?**\n   - Do they share any state or negotiate?\n   - Can one grammar suppress or modify another?\n   - Should grammars be aware of what other grammars are active?\n\n2. **What is the composition model?**\n   - Pure entity concatenation (current)?\n   - Priority/layering with masking?\n   - Domain-based routing (grammar A handles motion, B handles texture)?\n   - Grammars declare \"slots\" they fill?\n\n3. **How do macros interact with multiple grammars?**\n   - Each grammar interprets macros independently via paramsSchema?\n   - macroResponses annotations guide which grammars to adjust?\n   - Some macros are \"global\" vs \"per-grammar\"?\n   - LLM uses macroResponses to make coherent choices?\n\n4. **What happens on conflict?**\n   - Both emit (visual chaos)?\n   - One wins (priority)?\n   - They blend (how?)?\n   - It's a design error (grammars shouldn't conflict)?\n\n5. **Role of presets**\n   - Do presets guarantee coherent grammar combinations?\n   - Is \"these grammars work together\" part of preset design?\n   - Should presets declare grammar relationships?\n\n## Relevant contracts\n\n- `IGrammar.update(input: IntentFrame, previous: SceneFrame | null): SceneFrame`\n- `ICompositor.compose(frames: SceneFrame[]): SceneFrame`\n- `GrammarAnnotation.traits` — could indicate compatibility\n- `GrammarAnnotation.macroResponses` — how grammar responds to macros\n- `Preset.grammars` — list of grammars with enabled/params/priority\n\n## Approaches to evaluate\n\n### 1. Additive (status quo)\n- Document when it works and when it doesn't\n- Rely on preset curation to avoid conflicts\n- Traits annotations help LLM avoid bad combinations\n- Simple, but pushes complexity to users/LLM\n\n### 2. Priority-based layering\n- Grammars have explicit priority in preset\n- Higher-priority grammar's entities render on top\n- Doesn't solve semantic conflict, only visual layering\n\n### 3. Domain declarations\n- Grammar declares which intent channels it consumes\n- `consumes: [\"motion\", \"palette\"]` vs `consumes: [\"texture\"]`\n- Compositor routes accordingly\n- Conflict = build-time warning\n- Limits expressiveness\n\n### 4. Slot-based composition\n- Define visual \"slots\" (background field, mid particles, foreground glyphs)\n- Each grammar fills specific slots\n- Compositor arranges slots\n- More structured, less flexible\n\n### 5. Pre-grammar intent arbitration\n- Intents are merged/arbitrated before reaching grammars\n- Single \"negotiated\" IntentFrame per part\n- Grammars see consistent signals\n- Loses per-grammar character\n\n## Phase 0 avoidance\n\nPhase 0 uses a single grammar, so this is not blocking. But Phase 1 grammar iteration will hit this immediately when combining grammars.\n\n## Output\n\nEither a SPEC or additions to SPEC_004/SPEC_008 clarifying:\n1. Grammar composition semantics\n2.
