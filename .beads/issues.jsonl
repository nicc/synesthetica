Browser-first: Web Audio API + Web MIDI API + Canvas/WebGL\n2. Native-first: Electron + Node MIDI libraries + native rendering\n3. Hybrid: Core logic portable, adapters platform-specific\n\nConsiderations:\n- Browser has better MIDI support than commonly assumed (Web MIDI API)\n- Audio input in browser requires user permission flow\n- WebGL gives good rendering performance\n- Native gives lower latency but more setup friction\n\nOutput: Document platform decision in PRD.md under 'Platform assumptions'.
