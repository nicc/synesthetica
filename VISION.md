## Purpose
This document describes what Synesthetica is, who it is for, and why it should exist.

It is intentionally **non-technical**, relatively stable, and acts as a north star for all downstream decisions.

## One-Sentence Vision
> _A system that makes musical structure visible in real time, helping musicians develop intuition, ear, and expression through synesthetic feedback._

## Problem Statement
- Developing musical intuition by ear is difficult, slow, and often opaque
- Existing tools focus on analysis *after the fact*, not embodied, real-time feedback
- Visualisations often privilege spectacle over learnability or musical meaning

## Intended Audience
- **Primary**: musicians learning or refining their ear (initially the project author)
- **Secondary**: performing musicians seeking expressive, responsive visual accompaniment

## Core Value Proposition
- Makes harmony, pitch relationships, and musical motion perceptible at a glance
- Bridges instruments (e.g. keyboard → guitar) via a shared visual language
- Supports learning *in the moment*, not only through reflection

## Nature of the System
Synesthetica is conceived as an **instrument-like system**, not a conventional tool or product.

- It rewards learning, exploration, and repeated use
- Its expressiveness emerges through interaction and familiarity
- Mastery comes from understanding its internal logic, not from discovering features

Like a musical instrument or a language, Synesthetica should feel deeper over time without becoming more complex.

## What Success Looks Like
- The user can more quickly identify and reproduce chords and intervals by ear
- Visual feedback feels intuitive rather than distracting
- The system becomes a trusted learning and performance companion

## Non-Goals (Vision Level)
- Replacing traditional music theory education
- Acting as an automatic transcription or notation system
- Maximising visual spectacle at the expense of clarity
